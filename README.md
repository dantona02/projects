# Simulation of a planar three-body problem
This project simulates and visualizes the trajectories of the planar three-body-problem. The links to the corresponding papers the simualtion is based on, are provided in the [threebproblem.ipynp](https://github.com/dantona02/projects/blob/main/threebproblem.ipynb) notebook.
All the underlying basic physical and mathematical concepts of the simualatio and the n can also be found in this notebook.
## Setup of the notebook
The main purspose of this project is, to simualte a special cases of the three-body-problem with **zero angular momentum**. The papers introduces very specific inital conditions, even though a few parameters can be changed. Those are $m_3$, $v_1$ and $v_2$. All the other paramters are set according to the inital conditions.
